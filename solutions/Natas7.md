# Natas 7 Solution

When we select a link, notice that the query changes. If we change this query to an nonexistent page, we get
errors that say that the file wasn't found. A comment in the html and also the instructions say that the
password file is stored in `/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`. Simply change the page parameter in the url
to [`/etc/natas_webpass/natas8`](http://natas7.natas.labs.overthewire.org/index.php?page=/etc/natas_webpass/natas8) to get the password.
